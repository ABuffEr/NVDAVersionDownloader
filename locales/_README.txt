Instructions for translators

Take your preferred language file as template, and consider that:
1) .ini files under locales must be in ANSI;
2) don't touch the ID before equal sign;
3) don't translate strings like ^!varname^!;
4) the real exclamation mark must be prefixed with five symbols ^ (unfortunately, I have found no alternative solution).
Good work, and thanks for your contribution! :)
