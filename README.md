A simple .bat to download desired stable and latest snapshot versions of NVDA (from each branch available: rc, alpha, etc).

Available in English (original project), Spanish (thanks to [@nvdaes][2]), French (thanks to [@blindhelp][3]) and Italian (thanks to [@christianlm][4]).

## Installation

* Download .zip from [Releases section;][1]
* Extract .zip and put locales and _NVDAVersionDownloader.bat in a folder where you want (a path without spaces is preferable);
* Launch .bat and follow step-by-step process.

## Compatibility

Tested on Windows 7 and 10, but probably compatible with XP, Vista and Windows 8/8.1.

It requires wget, curl or powershell installed in same folder or system PATH.

Powershell should be present on almost all systems starting from XP.
